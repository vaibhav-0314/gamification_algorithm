## ‚ö° Python Functions

### **1. Reward / Penalty Calculation**
```python
def calculate_reward(issue, officer):
    if issue.status == "Resolved":
        if issue.verified_by_citizen:
            reward = base_points + (priority_score * 2)
            bonus = max(0, (deadline - resolution_time)) * decay_factor
            officer.reactive_points += reward + bonus
        else:
            officer.reactive_points -= penalty_points
    else:
        penalty = penalty_points + max(0, (resolution_time - deadline)) * decay_factor
        officer.reactive_points -= penalty


2. Preventive Points:
def add_preventive_points(officer, activity_type):
    activity_rewards = {
        "maintenance": 15,
        "monthly_report": 20,
        "awareness_drive": 25
    }
    officer.proactive_points += activity_rewards.get(activity_type, 0)


3. Participation Bonus:
def add_participation_bonus(officer, action):
    participation_rewards = {
        "weekly_login": 5,
        "verify_no_issues": 10
    }
    officer.proactive_points += participation_rewards.get(action, 0)


4. Complaint-Free Ward Bonus:
def add_complaint_free_bonus(officer, ward):
    if ward.total_complaints_in_period == 0:
        bonus = 20
        officer.proactive_points += bonus
        officer.complaint_free_bonus = bonus


5. Final Score Normalization:
def calculate_final_score(officer, ward_avg_complaints, proactive_weight=0.6, reactive_weight=0.4):
    weighted_score = (proactive_weight * officer.proactive_points) + (reactive_weight * officer.reactive_points)
    officer.final_score = min((weighted_score / (ward_avg_complaints + 1)) * 100, 100)


6. Weekly Leaderboard Update:
def update_weekly_leaderboard(officers):
    for officer in officers:
        officer.weekly_score = officer.final_score + officer.complaint_free_bonus
    leaderboard = sorted(officers, key=lambda x: x.weekly_score, reverse=True)
    return leaderboard
